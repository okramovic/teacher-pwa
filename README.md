# Teacher (PWA version)

Progressive web application for those of us who learn (human) languages and need to practice vocabulary. Target device is more a smartphone rather than desktop.

* App saves user's progress (local storage)
* It speaks in order to help learning/knowledge retention
* User can back-up his/her progress as separate file
* For Android and desktop users, after installation, it works completely offline *(Apple will hopefully start supporting Service workers soon...)*


Built using AngularJS, Materialize (Angular Materialize), Service workers, Speech Synthesis. Served by Heroku.
