- mozilla fallback solution when material-icons dont work




not that important? try when fresh


- if there’s duplicates in newly added dict, clear them
- add mtrlz preloader when i tap on show vocab, bcs people might get confused that its not reacting
- when loading words - alert user on each wrong word in his file until all are fine? (seems like hell for a person, but it ll prevent error later)


not neccessary
- change initial menu “load new words” - make it a material. dropdown so it looks better and is organized
