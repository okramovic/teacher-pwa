- decide what’s most important things to publish prototype


- remove non-used code


     using postCss and autoprefixer?
- do styling for safari as well
- do styling for IE (it could be gotcha) - they'd see i didnt finish my work

- hide word rating number






not that important? try when fresh
- add mtrlz preloader when i tap on show vocab, bcs people might get confused that its not reacting
- make sure no nonsense words (bug-giving) are in loaded dict/file
- add dropbox get file and upload file functionality
- when user clicks on word (test Q / A or in dict), it's copied to clipboard and small anouncement pops up



- if there’s duplicates in newly added dict, clear them

- when loading words - alert user on each wrong word in his file until all are fine? (seems like hell for a person, but it ll prevent error later)





not neccessary
- change initial menu “load new words” - make it a material. dropdown so it looks better and is organized
- ?? voice says hi on every app start to check voice availability

- highlight selected words in vocab
- add “delete vocab” from local storage functionality

6.nov.17
- i can do checked-ones test
- i can have test from unknown words
- wierd not focusing repaired by timeout
- if “from” voice speaks, it says first word only once
- when copy/pasting - it stores lang line twice - repair to only once
- add “repeat previous test” functionaility

7.nov.17
- round counter doesnt show wierd numbers /gets updated when appropriate
- add dates to Local Storage vocabs
- if theres no speech synthesis in browser, display no selects for voices
- i can download txt file with my current vocab

8.nov.17
- tap target thing in mtrlz (in word load menu), it explains whats the app about and for
- nicer div with dictionary selection/pasting
- add mtrlz modal for instructions how should pasted text look like
- accept only txt files
- when finished test, test screen fades away and after that my score fades-in
- make selects look good

11.nov.17
- input font-size during test-session too small
- interrupt loading new vocabs when they are empty or have only one line (=no words)
- when deleting localstorage and it would stay empty, delete it whole (so it’s properly reflected on welcome screen)
- filereader “accepts” only files with type “text/plain”, otherwise return alert
- set fallback font for mozilla (palatino linotype/book antiqua)
- mater.-icons are offline
- add breakpoints to change font-size (phones vs larger than 400px)

12.nov.17
- autochoose voices and langs for cz, de, eng  ||  or save them in local storage
- select on active or focus or what has some outline
- last round with zen mode ignores wrong answers and quits the test
- mozilla fallback solution when material-icons dont work


6 dec 2017
- make Practice button much larger font
- voice on/off switching sometimes doesnt react (?change event onclick to onchange?)
- fix example words to not be cz + eng
- dictionary words div must be wider
- check on site load whether browser is mozilla 
      (or other that also disables custom fonts)
      => in such case replace custom font with unicode chars.
- if browser doesnt speak, test cant be taken


25 dec
- done but tst with kris - make font for iphones even smaller
- desktop safari gives me trouble

26 dec
	⁃	on big screens, set (body height to 80vh,) margin top 10vh,bottom 10vh,
	⁃	 words section overflow: auto
	⁃	solved other way (store voices in shared service - make sure they dont reload all time)
	⁃	on mobile mozilla - on initial screen - put x instead of delete button
	⁃	feedback div after test 
	⁃	is cramped to fit window (use css overflow)
	⁃	calculating final result is wierd (subtract wrong answers)
	⁃	make it look same on iphone as it does on android
	⁃	select are center aligned - for safari this seems impossible
	⁃	add favicon to get rid of console error
	⁃	added apple homescreen icons

27 dec
- cleaned more unused code
- when starting new test - previous result doesn't show anymore
- when test starts - inout field auto-focuses

28 dec
	⁃	rearrange Css into different files: elements, classes, media Querries
	⁃	when deleting Local storage Dict, and confirm appears, replace Dict name chars ’_’ for ‘ ‘
     -    enable auto deleting old caches
     -    enable auto-updating cached files to newest version
     - some beautiful animation when test has finished (like khan academy)

               https://codepen.io/ComeonCreative/pen/ZBYwwL     - seems most natural

               minimalistic, good for mobile performance? - https://codepen.io/moonglows76/pen/BRVrgZ
               this one works great with camera!!!  but is static - https://codepen.io/palmaswell/pen/zdZgRb?limit=all&page=4&q=confetti

               also nice, minimalistic       https://codepen.io/orrybaram/pen/LxOMwG
               this one starts great, but then it gets wierd     https://codepen.io/JTParrett/pen/YxrNVQ
               i like the shapes and colors here  https://codepen.io/lilianqian/pen/OxzeyZ
     - if previous test was 100% without wrong answers, next test it shows up
