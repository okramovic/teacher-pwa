- decide what’s most important things to publish prototype



- enable auto deleting old caches
- enable auto-updating cached files to newest version

- do styling for safari as well
- do styling for IE (it could be gotcha) - they'd see i didnt finish my work






- word rating changes wierdly - later also hide word rating number


- remove non-used code


add dropbox get file and upload file functionality


not that important? try when fresh
- when user clicks on word (test Q / A or in dict), it's copied to clipboard and small anouncement pops up


- if there’s duplicates in newly added dict, clear them
- add mtrlz preloader when i tap on show vocab, bcs people might get confused that its not reacting
- when loading words - alert user on each wrong word in his file until all are fine? (seems like hell for a person, but it ll prevent error later)


not neccessary
- change initial menu “load new words” - make it a material. dropdown so it looks better and is organized
- ?? voice says hi on every app start to check voice availability
